# LD.Numeric
 

When creating a game, you'll be dealing with complex types of values. 
Let's look at some examples

- Very large values over 10^100000000 (Most commonly used in idle games.)
- Values expressed as a percentage relative to 1 (often called percent value, To use an RPG game as an example, 100% increased power.)
- Values that require numeric units to be represented by alphabets (1000 => 1.0A, 1000000 => 1.0B)

I'm writing a tool to easily represent these types of values and apply them to calculations.
