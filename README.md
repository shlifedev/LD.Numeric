# LD.Numeric

It is an extended fork of [BreakInfinity] (https://github.com/Razenpok/BreakInfinity.cs).

- In an environment where decimal accuracy is not required, the CPU time has been significantly reduced by efficiently calculating the number of digits of double.
- In addition, an efficient alphabetic conversion process for the number of digits has been added.

Many optimisations have been made.
If you want to use this library in an environment where large numbers must be used a lot and want to minimise CPU time and memory usage, try this library.
